DigColl-xml-generator
=====================

Python script to generate Fedora XML files from template files and CSV data.  

For testing purposes, you can use the included umam.xml, umdm.xml, and data10.csv as the XML and data files (the program will prompt you to specify those files).

The program assumes that the XML templates and data files will be in the same working directory as the python script. It also assumes that there will be a sub-directory called 'output' for the resulting XML files.
